  about-description:
    australia: "On November 13, 2012, Tunland came to Australia, a wild and magical red land. Again, the Tunland, which adopts the world advanced development measure, strictly follows European technology standard, and carries the world-class Cummins diesel engine, drove through Australia’s primitive and vast land and got through the cross-field tests and evaluations in complicated road conditions like Jungle and mountain road. That fully exemplified Tunland’s strong power and extraordinary performance in high-temperature circumstance."

    south_africa: "On October 16, 2012, Tunland Global Journey of Discovery kicked off from Pretoria of South Africa. In the presence of local automobile journalists, VIP customers, and dealers, Tunland drove through the Lesotho Highland, reputed as <i>The Country within a Country</i> in South Africa, and withstood the tests by 8 complicated road conditions like highway, mountain road, gravel road, jungle, rock, quagmire, etc. All told, Tunland got through 120-plus kilometers of road condition test, and perfectly construed its outstanding power performance and trafficability. "
    chile: "On January 8, 2013, Tunland came to the world’s thinnest country Chile, which spans 38 latitudes and resembles a skirt of the South America. To fit in with local culture, Tunland was renamed TERRACOTA (literally Terra-Cotta Warriors) in Chile. By virtue of Cummins ISF2.8’s unmatched power and its 4D cross-field chassis adopting European technology, Tunland could easily handle extremely harsh desert and frozen soil environment. In addition, with its high-strength body and smooth maneuverability, Tunland drove in a composed and steady manner despite the complicated climate. "
    malaysia: "On July 12, 2013, Tunland strode over the Pacific Ocean and came to Malaysia, a SE Asian country teeming with human and cultural features. In consideration of local culture and customs, Tunland got its new name: Savanna. In Terengganu, a zone in East Coast of Malay Peninsula, thanks to the integration between the world advanced technology and Europe’s design philosophy, Tunland drove freely through different typical road conditions including rainforest, river beach, sand beach, gravel road, muddy road, and highway. In addition, its strong power, and decent and cozy interior trimmings brought great passion to the entire driving journey."
